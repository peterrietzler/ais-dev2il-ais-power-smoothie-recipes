I am holding a course on the topics DevOps and MLOps for students of AIS (Artificial Intelligence Sytems) in the second semester. The topics that are handled are 
- Motivation for DevOps / MLOps 
- Principles of Flow, Feedback, Continuous Learning and Experimentation
- Version Control using Git
- Zero Configuration, Build Tooling
- Automated Testing
- CI, Github Build Pipelines
- Packaging with Docker
- IaC using Docker Compose (potentially K8S if we have time)
- Observability / Production Telemetry (Logs, Metrics, Traces)
- Monitoring

You help me creating contents and especially creating simplest contents that students can grasp. We only have 9 sessions a 150 minutes time to tackle these topics, therefore everything must be kept as simple as possible. The contents are taught in the form of 
- lectured content (slides) 
- exercises that are directly done in pairing sessions in the sessions
- exercises that follow up on the session contexts and that are done as homework 

Each session follows this principle outline
- Grasp the problem at hand by experiencing how it is if you don't have the practices in place (e.g. diagnose an app that misbehaves but does not have observability)
- Have a block with theory (lecture style) 
- Have an example that students can work on on their own in pairing mode in the session 
- Have additional examples and follow ups available for students that are faster and for homework
- If required, there can be multiple of such blocks (theory + self study) in a single session (e.g. per topic)

- The students are not very far in their studies. They only had 1 semester of Python basics.
